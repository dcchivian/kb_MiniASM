    </p>

    <p>
    MiniASM is an ultra-fast overlap-layout-consensus based de novo assembler for noisy long reads developed by Heng Li.
    It has been shown to assemble ~50X microbial PacBio reads into a draft assembly of a small number of (sometimes 1)
    contigs in a matter of minutes. MiniASM derives this performance from a locality-sensitive hashing based
    overlapper implemented in minimap.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Known limitations:</b>  MiniASM does not support short Illumina reads.
    MiniASM is still in early development stage, and has only been tested on a dozen of PacBio and Oxford
    Nanopore bacterial data sets. The consensus sequence computed by MiniASM may not be as accurate as slower and more mature methods such as HGAP3.
